ðŸ“š Library Membership System

This project is a web-based library membership system developed using the Laravel PHP framework and PostgreSQL. It provides users with the ability to register, log in, browse information about authors, and interact with available books.

The system enables basic CRUD operations on books and authors, and includes user authentication. Registered users can view book details, check availability, and perform actions such as borrowing or returning books. Administrators may have additional access to manage the catalog.

The project follows the MVC architecture provided by Laravel and demonstrates how modern web development tools can be used to build a simple but functional library management system.
